### Project Topic  

This project is a classification problem, set to predict whether an employee in a mulit-national company is likely to be promoted or not after the Naive Bayesian process. This problem is important to solve because it will uncover the features and values that will increase an employees likelyhood of being promoted, allowing empoloyees at this company to prepare and set goals that align with our findings.

My goal is to predict if a candidate will be promoted or not and to use that information to add a column titled 'prediction' with a binary identifier for each candidate and then compare its accuracy to the actual 'is_promoted' column.

I hope to learn details about this company's promotion criteria and how features that are controllable by the employee (such as education and number of trainings completed) and uncontrollable (like age and gender) impact their probability of being promoted.  

### Bonus  

By adding a second model and splitting the dataset into two - by controllable and uncontrollable features, I may uncover trends about this company's promomtion criteria that may be questionable or undesireable. In my opinion this is a more interesting approach than a generic predictive model from an entire dataset.
